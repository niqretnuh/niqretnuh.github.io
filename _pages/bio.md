Hi! I’m **Hunter Qin**, a fourth-year accelerated BS/MS student in Computer Science and Mathematics at Vanderbilt University. My research explores the mathematical foundations of machine learning—especially **geometric deep learning**, **optimal transport**, and **representation learning**—and I aim to translate these theories into practical advances in vision and language transformers as well as biomedical discovery.

I have been working in the  **Machine Intelligence & Neural Technology (MINT) Lab** under the supervision of **Dr. Soheil Kolouri**, where I study the theory of low‑rank adaptation and model compression on large‐scale transformer networks. Concurrently, I have been an active researcher in the **Maizie Zhou Computational Biology Lab** with **Dr. Maizie (Xin) Zhou**, applying geometric deep learning and optimal‐transport–assisted representation learning to spatial transcriptomics and single‐cell RNA‐seq data to uncover cellular heterogeneity through self‐supervised frameworks.

I also enjoy turning these ideas into real-world software. As a Software Engineer, I’ve led multiple machine learning projects from development through deployment—feel free to visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haoran-qin/) for details.

Outside academia, I’m passionate about cooking, music, and running. I particularly enjoy Asian-inspired recipes, Bebop and Hard Bop jazz as well as Romantic classical music (especially Chopin), and long-distance runs!
